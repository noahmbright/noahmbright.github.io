        <h2> Some toys </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> A GPU implementation of <a href="game_of_life.html">
                    Conway's Game of Life. </a> You can set the board as 
                you like, and then that gets buffered to a texture. That
                textured "image" is processed using a 3x3 kernel to determine
                if what cells are alive or dead in the next iteration, and the
                updated board is rendered to another texture, as well as to the
                screen. Those two textures go back and forth for the rest of
                the simulation.
            </li>

            <li> <a href="mandelbrot.html"> A Mandelbrot Set </a>
                implementation. A first pass uses some functional programming
                in vanilla JavaScript to get a correct Mandelbrot set up on a
                canvas. With that complete, a real explorer is implemented in
                WebGL using a fragment shader. This is both my first exposure
                to JavaScript and to shader art, I guess.
            </li>

            <li> 
                <a href="geometry.html"> Some simple geometry exercises.</a>
                Here I try to lump in as many graphics fundamentals as I can
                into a light emitting sphere orbiting another sphere. Doing
                this in JS without libraries like GLM, this has been a good
                opportunity to really understand how the transformations
                used in graphics work. 
            </li>

            <li> <a href="pong.html"> Pong Clone </a>
                A simple pong clone. A first foray into collision detection and
                some minimal game state. Enjoy.
