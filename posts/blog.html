        <p>
            Here I'll try to collect whatever I feel I understand well enough
            to share, so that maybe someone else can learn something as well.
        </p>


        <p>
            <a href="webgl_game_of_life.html"> The Game of Life in (Web)OpenGL.</a> This
            implementation uses the standard ping-ponging tricks for rendering
            between a pair of textures and the canvas to simulate timesteps.
            The "novelty" here is the usage of every single byte in the
            textures, which taught me more than I could have imagined about
            textures, their format, and how to render to them.

        <p>
            <a href="risc_v.html"> RISC-V Interpreter.</a> A summary of much of
            what I learned in a graduate level computer architecture class.
            This was our final project, so I only present a high level overview
            without any code.
