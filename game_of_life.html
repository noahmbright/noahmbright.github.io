        <h1> The Game of Life </h1>

        <div class="game-of-life">
            <p>
                The Game of Life was devised by the mathematician John Conway.
                The rules are simple. At a given moment in time, a cell is
                either alive or dead. A cell interacts with its 8 neighbors at
                every time step. If a live cell has fewer than two live
                neighbors, it dies. If a live cell has two or three live
                neighbors, it survives. If it has more than three, it dies. If
                a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes alive.
            </p>

            <p>
                The default board contains a single glider. You can randomize
                the board, or you can click a cell to switch it to/from alive
                from/to dead.
            </p>

            <p>
                The randomize button will run through all the cells, 
                turning them alive with a probability you can set with 
                the input field. It defaults to 0.5.

            <p>
                The program works by rendering back and forth between two
                textures. Upon CPU updates, the board is buffered to the
                currently active framebuffer. The value in the red channel of
                the texture represents a cell's status. A good next step would
                be to utilize the other 4 channels, and try to map each
                quadrant of the board to a particular channel.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The fragment shader runs a 3x3 kernel over the board. The
                perimeter of the kernel is all 1s, and there's an 9 in the
                middle. The 1s count the number of surrounding alive cells,
                and the 9 bumps that sum if the current cell is alive. The
                9 is an idea I got from 
                <a href=https://iquilezles.org/articles/gameoflife/ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Inigo Quilez.</a> Initially, I had nested
                branches in the shader - one to check if the current cell was
                alive or dead, and then nested update rules. This is correct,
                but by inflating the sum for living cells, you can 
                unambiguously map the convolution sum in a selection with 
                the GLSL ternary operator, which will probably compile down
                to a branch free program on the GPU.

                Like above, this is another WebGL implementation of GoL, but this one uses every single bit
                inside that texture to do the simulation.

        <h1> WebGPU Implementation </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                WebGL is obviously capable of the ping-pong render-to-texture
                technique for GPGPU, but it isn't exactly ergonomic. WebGPU
                is another graphics API that offers compute shaders for the 
                same purpose.
