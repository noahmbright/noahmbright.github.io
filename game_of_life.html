                The Game of Life was devised by the mathematician John Conway.
                The rules are simple. At a given moment in time, a cell is
                either alive or dead. A cell interacts with its 8 neighbors at
                every time step. If a live cell has fewer than two live
                neighbors, it dies. If a live cell has two or three live
                neighbors, it survives. If it has more than three, it dies. If
                a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes alive.
