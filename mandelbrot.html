            <h3> The Vanilla Javascript version </h3>

            <p>
                Here's a standard imperative implementation of the Mandelbrot
                set. This is the first thing I've programmed in JS. The
                Mandelbrot set is produced by starting at 0, and iterating the
                complex-valued function z_n(c) = z_{n-1}^2 + c until either a
                maximum number of iterations is hit, or the magnitude of z_n
                exceeds 2. Because JavaScript is an academic, funcational language,
                this implementation uses a higher-order function that returns a
                z_n(z) function for different values of c. The canvas element
                below represents the complex plane. Dark pixels represent
                choices of c where the maximum number of iterations is hit, and
                we consider that point to be "in" the Mandelbrot set. Colored
                points are colored by the number of iterations they take to
                diverge.

            <h3> Using WebGL </h3>
            
            <p>
                Maybe one day I'll get around to enhancing the CPU JS version
                above, but here is a simple WebGL explorer. Hover your mouse over
                a section of the set to zoom in. The fragment shader gets uniforms
                describing the canvas dimensions, as well as what subset of the
                complex plane is currently in view. Using those and the fragment
                coordinate, each pixel can be assigned a complex number, which is
                used as c in the iteration process. That fragment can then be 
                colored accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
                After reaching the point that the image becomes noticably pixelated,
                the zooming slows and eventually reverses, until the full set is in 
                view again. Then you can zoom in on another point.
            </p>

            <canvas id="webgl-mandelcanvas" width="512", height="512" 
                style="border:1px solid #000000;"></canvas>
            <div>
                <script src ="scripts/mandelbrot_webgl.js"></script>
            </div>

            <p>
                A good next step could be to implement a big decimal type to get
                better resolution, because it currently hits the limits of a 
                double's resolution relatively quickly. The coloring is also not 
                particularly pretty at this point, but for a first attempt at 
                shader art, I think I got what I wanted out of this little project.
