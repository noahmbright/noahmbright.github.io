            <h3> The Vanilla Javascript version </h3>

            <p>
                Here's a standard imperative implementation of the Mandelbrot
                set. This was my first real experience doing much of anything
                in JS. The Mandelbrot set iterates the function z_n(c) = z_{n-1}^2
                + c until either a maximum number of iterations is hit, or the
                magnitude of z_n exceeds 2. This implementation uses a closure
                that returns this z_n(c) function for different values of c.
                The canvas element below represents the complex plane. Dark pixels
                represent choices of c where the maximum number of iterations is
                hit, and we consider that point to be "in" the Mandelbrot set.
                Colored points are colored by the number of iterations they take
                to diverge.

                To get some more threading practice in JS, a good next step here
                would be to use WebWorkers. That's in progress.

            <h3> Using WebGL </h3>
            
            <p>
                What's even more interesting to me than WebWorkers is WebGL. 
                This section is still under construction, but this is going to 
                be an implemention of the Mandelbrot set that does the iteration
                on the GPU, and obviously also the rendering. Also in the works 
                is the ability to zoom in and explore the set, where you can 
                see the fractal nature of the set.
