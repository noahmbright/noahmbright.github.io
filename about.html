        <p>
            Welcome to my little autobiography.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today (November 2024), I'm a software engineer in the Boston area.
            I got my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the
            University of Pittsburgh this last April. My Bachelor's was in
            Physics and Math, also from Pitt.
        </p>

        <p>
            After getting my BS and realizing I didn't really want to be an
            academic, I went back to school for ECE. I figured that I could
            find an avenue to apply what I learned in undergrad, or learn a
            little bit about programming. I had done plenty of scientific
            computing in Numpy and Scipy, but had never done "real"
            programming, and was curious to see what that was really about.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was funded to do optics research during my degree, but my
            interests were definitely swaying towards programming; I think the
            same part of me that likes fundamental physics like fundamental CS
            - there's something romantic about writing C (sometimes). My
            department didn't offer many programming courses, so I volunteered
            to TA for the sophomore C++ class, as well as the two Data
            Structures and Algorithms classes we offered. I had to teach myself
            both C++ and DSA to prepare, but the fear of looking stupid
            in front of the kids kept me diligent in my studies.
        </p>


        <p>
            Learning C++ was fun (as much as you can say you "learned" C++),
            but in my last semester of school, I took a computer architecture
            class, and that was when I really got hooked on CS and programming.
            The professor would mention what the compiler could do before it
            emitted assembly and I would always think "the compiler can do
            what???". For our final project, we wrote an <a
            href="projects.html#architecture-simulator">architecture simulator</a>, which
        only in hindsight I realize was a simple assembly interpreter with
        extra bookkeeping. That was one of the first real projects I ever
        finished, and it was a lot of fun.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, being out of school, I spend a lot of time continuing to study
            what I sort of feel like I missed in school. Now, I couldn't
            imagine myself doing much other than coding for a day job, but I
            really loved (and still do) math and physics, and we all need to
            find our own ways. Part of the motivation for making this site is
            to show my enthusiasm and what I've studied myself. I'm also
            hoping that my projects will end up complete and well documented
            enough to become teaching resources. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It's fun to continue to have something to learn though - that will
            always be there with something as broad as programming. My current
            infatuation is with compilers. I had a moment reading about
            dominance frontiers where it clicked that compilers are absolutely
            the coolest thing ever. You get to make coding as most people know
            it possible, and there's so much to learn that you'll never get
            bored. I taught myself General Relativity as an undergrad so I
            could do research, so I'm sure I can handle some graph algorithms
            (or whatever you might be hiring for). See my <a
            href="projects.html"> projects </a> for some of the things I've
            been studying.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from coding, I like to draw, run, do muay thai, and I absolutely 
            love learning languages. My speciality is Japanese, but I also dabble
            in a bit of Korean.

            I use vim, btw.
