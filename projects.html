                Here's a collection of things I've been working on. Most of these
                are things I've worked on since finishing school, trying to learn
                programming fundamentals.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site is a bit of a project itself, trying to see what
                basic HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript can get you. 
                <a href="applets.html">Here</a> are some in-browser toys
                I've thrown together that I wouldn't really consider their own
                standalone projects. These are all written in JavaScript and
                WebGL. I've put together my own little WebGL library, and these
                toys have been really useful exercises for learning how to
                program the GPU; obviously in a graphical sense, but also more
                general purpose, see the <a href="game_of_life.html"> Game of
                Life </a>. A fluid simulation will be my next GPGPU project on
                here. I've also been writing a game engine of sorts in C/C++
                using OpenGL, but I'm not entirely ready to show that off yet.

                Read on for things that warrant their own repo.

                    <p>
                        This was the final project for the computer architecture course I
                        took in my last semester of school, which was really influential on
                        me. I would link to the code if it wasn't going to be reused in 
                        future semesters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of the project was to write a program that simulated an
                        out-of-order (OoO), speculative CPU with branch prediction and register
                        renaming. The simulator would read in a configuration
                        parameterizing the CPU, as well as a program describing the initial
                        state of the CPU's memory and a program written in a subset of
                        RISC-V assembly. Our simulator would interpret the program and
                        output the execution time in number of cycles, as well as report
                        bottlenecks in the execution pipeline, as measured by where it was
                        necessary to issue no-ops to stall processing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To increase performance, modern CPUs use pipelined OoO
                        execution. Pipelining is a form of parallelism achieved
                        by having different processing steps occur
                        simultaneously for different instructions. For example,
                        in one CPU cycle, an add instruction might be executing the
                        addition operation while the next instruction is
                        getting fetched. That way, the CPU's add unit and
                        fetch unit are both utilized, instead of waiting
                        for each other, even though their results are unrelated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OoO execution is another optimization that allows
                        instructions to execute when their data is ready, as
                        opposed to when it is their turn in program order. For
                        example, maybe you want to add a and b. First you'd load
                        them into registers, and then in a third instruction you'd
                        add them. But maybe your program loads a and b, but then
                        immediately after also loads c and d, which are unrelated 
                        to the a+b intruction. An OoO processor can execute  
                        a+b as soon as a and b are ready, even if that might be
                        before c and d are loaded, as per program order.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OoO execution and pipelining obviously introduce
                        concerns about program correctness. These issues are
                        called hazards, and come in three flavors: write after
                        write (WAW), write after read (WAR), and read after
                        write (RAW). A RAW hazard is a true data dependence; a
                        register is written to, and then afterwards, a subsequent
                        instruction reads the result. WAWs occur when two instructions
                        write to the same register; if the writes occur out of order,
                        thereafter, the register contains the wrong value. In the WAR 
                        case, a write to a register occurs after a read; if these are
                        out of order, the read value will prematurely read a value
                        that should not yet have been there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These hazards only exist because a register is at risk
                        of being written to before it ought to be. This issue
                        wouldn't exist if we had an infinitely large register
                        file to use, and only wrote to a register once. This
                        motivates a technique called register renaming. The
                        processor has a limited number of physical registers,
                        while a compiler can output code using any number of
                        "architected" registers. The processor keeps a mapping
                        of its physical registers to the compiler's architected
                        registers, as well as a free list of registers that do
                        not currently contain a live architected register's
                        value. When an architected register is written to, it
                        gets assigned a new free physical register. This allows
                        the processor to maintain an appearance of only writing
                        to unused registers, despite its finite register file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The real complication in the processor was the use of branch
                        prediction along with OoO speculative execution. Branch
                        instructions in the program are assigned a branch predictor, a
                        state machine describing if the branch is likely to be taken or
                        not; it's possible that this prediction is incorrect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since the processor is pipelined and executing out of order,
                        it fetches a branch instruction and guesses what comes next, 
                        and actually continues updating its state with results that
                        might become void if it turns out its branch prediction was
                        wrong. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between processing results and writing to the register
                        file, results are stored in the ReOrder Buffer (ROB).
                        The ROB is a queue that literally re-applies order to
                        instructions; when instructions are fetched, they get
                        stored in buffers called reservation stations, where
                        they wait for their operands. This is what allows them
                        to execute when ready, as opposed to when its their
                        turn in program order. And importantly, this is where
                        they actually begin to become disordered. Before OoO
                        execution, instructions get tagged in an entry in the
                        ROB. When an instruction's result is ready, it gets
                        written to its corresponding ROB entry, and marked as
                        ready to commit to the register file. If a result makes
                        it to the front of the queue and is tagged as ready,
                        it was truly supposed to execute, it had the correct
                        operands, and will get written to the register. If 
                        an incorrectly predicted branch instruction makes it 
                        to the front of the queue, the processor can flush its
                        state, correct its program counter, and restart execution
                        from where it should have gone.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There's some extra bookkeeping in the register file and
                        those reservation stations that I won't go into here, 
                        but that's the high level overview a semester of 
                        computer architecture. Extensions to the project would
                        be to include a more sophisticated memory model for 
                        caches, paging, and multicore coherency.

                        This project hit a bit of a wall once I got to code
                        generation. I originally planned on targeting LLVM,
                        hence the name. But my goal wasn't exactly to learn
                        an LLVM API, and I didn't want to get hung up on 
                        accurately emitting my own SSA form assembly. When
                        this project resumes, I'll probably target a 
                        specific assembly dialect.
