                Here's a collection of things I've been working on. Most of these
                are things I've worked on since finishing school, trying to learn
                programming fundamentals.

                This site is a bit of a project itself, trying to see what
                basic HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript can get you. <a
                href="applets.html"> here </a> are some in-browser toys I've
            thrown together that I wouldn't really consider their own
            standalone projects. Read on for things that warrant their own
            repo.

                    <p>
                        This was the final project for the computer architecture course I
                        took in my last semester of school, which was really influential on
                        me. I would link to the code if it wasn't going to be reused in 
                        future semesters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of the project was to write a program that simulated an
                        out-of-order (OoO), speculative CPU with branch prediction and register
                        renaming. The simulator would read in a configuration
                        parameterizing the CPU, as well as a program describing the initial
                        state of the CPU's memory and a program written in a subset of
                        RISC-V assembly. Our simulator would interpret the program and
                        output the execution time in number of cycles, as well as report
                        bottlenecks in the execution pipeline, as measured by where it was
                        necessary to stall processing.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The real complication in the processor was the use of branch
                        prediction along with OoO, speculative execution. Branch
                        instructions in the program are assigned a branch predictor, a
                        state machine describing if the branch is likely to be taken or
                        not; it's possible that this prediction is incorrect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To increase performance, modern CPUs use pipelined, OoO
                        execution. Pipelining is a form of parallelism achieved
                        by having different processing steps occur
                        simultaneously for different instructions. For example,
                        in one cycle, an add instruction might be executing the
                        addition operation while the next instruction is
                        getting fetched. That way, the add unit on the CPU and
                        the fetch unit are both utilized, instead of waiting
                        for each other when their results are unrelated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OoO execution is another optimization that allows
                        instructions to execute when their data is ready, as
                        opposed to when it is their turn in program order. For
                        example if you want to add a and b, but between their
                        computation and the addition, you also compute c,
                        out-of-order execution allows the processor to skip
                        waiting on c.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        OoO execution and pipelining obviously introduce
                        concerns about program correctness. These issues are
                        called hazards, and come in three flavors: write after
                        write (WAW), write after read (WAR), and read after
                        write (RAW). A RAW hazard is a true data dependence; a
                        register is written to, and then afterwards, a subsequent
                        instruction reads the result. WAWs occur when two instructions
                        write to the same register; if the writes occur out of order,
                        thereafter, the register contains the wrong value. In the WAR 
                        case, a write to a register occurs after a read; if these are
                        out of order, the read value will premature read a value
                        that should not yet have been there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These risks only exist because a register is at risk of
                        being written to before it ought to be. This issue
                        wouldn't exist if we had an infinitely large register
                        file to use, and only wrote to a register once. This
                        motivates the technique called register renaming.
                        Whenever a register is going to be written to, the
                        processor renames it. It keeps a mapping of real,
                        physical registers to artificial registers it uses for
                        renaming, as well as a free list of physical registers
                        that don't contain a live value, still needing to be
                        read in its current state.
